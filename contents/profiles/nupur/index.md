With 15 years of experience across 3 countries, Nupur Arya brings a global
perspective to COCH. Having started her career at PwC in New Delhi, she
transitioned to investment banking in New York with Merrill Lynch and
subsequently Lehman Brothers. She later joined Nomura in Hong Kong as
Asia Head of the structured credit syndicate and secondary trading
business. After serving as a consultant to IFC, part of the World Bank
group in New Delhi, Nupur joined IAL, an entertainment company where
she currently advises the Board on Strategy and Finance. Her journey from
New York’s Wall Street to India’s Main Street has empowered her with a
multinational perspective on building and conducting businesses with a
connected worldview.

Through her work with Sasakawa India Leprosy Foundation, American
India Foundation and Sakhi she has tried to measure her contribution in
meaningfully impacted lives rather than statistics on a balance sheet. Her
role as an investor in social impact firms, advisor to start-ups, mentor to
young professionals and guide to university students has provided a
renewed sense of purpose. She has also been invited by faculty of FMS
and IILM to be a guest speaker.

Her passion around mental health is extremely personal. Daughter to one
of India’s most formidable mental health experts, Dr. Rajni Arya, she has
grown up in an environment surrounded by high caliber professionals of the
field. Having seen the benefits in clients and in her own personal life, she is
committed to offering the same high quality, holistic mental health help to
others.
