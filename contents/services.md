## Children

##### 1. Counselling and Therapy

At COCH we provide individual, group, and couples therapy for children. These services are
for a wide variety of concerns and aim at helping individuals and families
improve their experiences, their functioning, and their performance in school,
at home or at work. 

Some of our core areas of work and intervention in counselling and therapy
are:

  - Stress
  - Anxiety
  - Depression
  - Loneliness
  - Suicide
  - Behavioural Addiction
  - Conduct Disorder
  - Substance Use disorder
  - Eating Disorders
  - ADHD
  - Oppostional Defiant Disorder (ODD)
  - Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)

##### 2. Development Services

Children reach developmental milestones at their own pace. Minor or temporary
delays are usually no cause for alarm, but an ongoing delay or multiple can
lead to issues later in life.
Delay in reaching language, thinking, and motor skills milestones is called
developmental delay.

Developmental delay may be caused by a variety of factors, including heredity,
problems with pregnancy, and premature birth. The cause is not always known
and sometimes there is no cure. However, a timely diagnosis and intervention
can identify underlying conditions and stop them from worsening.
At COCH we assist you with Early intervention to help your child&#39;s progress and
development into adulthood.

#####  3. Assessments
As a multi-disciplinary centre, our services include assessment and therapy
for concerns related to mental health. These could include assistance related
to development delays and disorders, learning related disabilities, relationship
challenges, and language problems.
Our clinicians are from different training backgrounds and disciplines and our
services include psychological assessment, neuropsychological testing, and
developmental evaluations for individuals of all ages (toddlers through adults).
The goals of such assessments are to :
  
  1. Identify and clarify any specific difficulties.
  2. Explain how a person is affected, and
  3. Provide guidance for how a person can be helped best. 

We assess for a wide variety of concerns as follows:-

**STAR** (Services For Teens At Risk Program)  This combines clinical and outreach services to help prevent risk behaviours in adolescents. It consists of  an internationally observed protocol for adolescents at risk of substance use disorder, suicide prevention etc.  It comprises of building awareness among vulnerable groups through targeted intervention, education of professionals, and the treatment of at-risk youth and their families.
 
The program focuses on the causality of adolescent crisis’, and has helped to identify the role of academic pressure, loneliness, inadequacy, substance abuse, and mood disorders as risk factors for turbulence among the youth. Consequently, we have developed national practice guidelines for the treatment of and management of adolescent stress, anxiety, depression and suicidal behaviour.
 
**ASAP** (Adolescent Suicide Awareness Program) Through this our mission is to offer state-of-the-art (psychological) emergency responsive care for children and adolescents with depression or anxiety, or who are at risk for suicidal behaviour.
 
## Parents

Our goal is to change or transform even the most difficult problem
behaviours and improve and strengthen the parent-child relationship.
At COCH, through our relational, playful, light-hearted collaborative
approach, our therapists help children enhance their emotional and
behavioural regulation. We use child centric interventions and strategies,
along with verbal counselling skills so that children, teens, and young
adults, feel safe, nurtured and nourished. We are outcome oriented and
goal directed and work on mutually agreed upon timelines.

COCH provides a unique experience for children (ages 2-7) and their
parents through **P**arent-**C**hild **I**nteraction **T**herapy **(PCIT)**, wherein we teach parents to utilize the skills of play therapy to reinforce their child’s
positive behaviours and decrease their child’s problematic behaviours.

For parents of children (ages 8–17) we build **E**ffective **P**arenting
**I**nterventions through **C**onsequences **(EPIC)** skills in parents, to enhance
their effectiveness.

## Schools
School counselling  is designed to facilitate student achievement, improve
student behaviour and attendance, and help students develop socially.  All
schools have full-time counsellors on staff in order to support students who
are experiencing personal or academic challenges, help students choose
careers and plan for college, and intervene when students face behavioural,
physical, or mental health challenges.
In today’s fast changing world and with the kind of student numbers schools
have, it is near impossible for two or five or ten counsellors to do justice to a
school full of children and their needs. As therapists and agents of change, we
have been training, sensitising and empowering Teachers across the country
with our “**TE**achers **A**s **M**entors” **(TEAM)** program. This is designed to build
basic relational and mentoring skills in all Teachers so that a child feels secure
and helped and Teachers are effective and competent and feel confident in
reaching out.

## Suicide
Suicide is tough to talk about, but learning the facts and signs can save a life. At
COCH, our mission is to generate awareness, sensitise and train individuals,
institutions and organizations to recognize those at risk, and intervene if needed.

Suicide is the third leading cause of death among young adults and second
leading cause among college students in India. Each year approximately 5,000
individuals between the ages of 15 and 24 take their own life. Most of those
who die could have been helped. Someone considering suicide frequently
confides in a friend or relative, who may be able to help the person to seek
appropriate and life-saving treatment.



Because each individual is unique, there is no single reason why someone has
suicidal thoughts or may attempt to kill themselves. While factors that may
contribute to having suicidal thoughts may vary, what is significant is that people
attempting or thinking of one give many verbal and nonverbal warning signs
making it preventable.
Through our training we empower and equip people to identify and handle
suicidal clients, help differentiate the myths from facts and also help
institutions and the government set up suicide helplines.
Our &#39;**Lighthouse model**, focuses on training those who most directly interact
with students. 

Topics include:
- Warning signs
- Myths
- Response modes
- Screening tools
- Risk factors
- Protective Factors
- Suicide statistics | research
- Risk assessments

## Training

Throughout history there has been a deeply embedded conviction that under the right conditions people can help each other come to grips with problems and challenges in living.

 

Statistics today reveal that only a small fraction of help sought on any given day comes from professional helpers and therapists. Most people seek help in informal ways from informal sources. The analytics make for a convincing argument for us to stipulate, that as a society, we need Life Management Skills to be as much a part of our School and College curriculum as Math and History.

 

We at CoCH see ourselves as enablers striving to institutionalize this conviction through our vision to train people to be able to help others and themselves deal with the distressing challenges of life. As a first step towards actualizing this vision our mission is to build Counseling skills in Graduate and Post graduate students of Psychology and Counseling who have studied the curriculum but not had the opportunity to undergo skill training under the guided supervision of experts. Through bridging this gap between knowledge and application we envision these students becoming our ambassadors in Co-create Change.

 


Thereafter, as a part of our training vision, we aspire to square the circle by building counseling, mentoring and problem solving skills in each and every individual in society.

## Institutional
Counseling helps people identify issues, difficulties and problems caused by thoughts, feelings and emotions and encourages them to respond and make
progress towards resolution. Whilst a little bit of stress provides workers with the motivation to increase productivity and efficiency, too much stress can be counterproductive.
Providing psychological therapy for stressed employees can have many beneficial effects. Counselling in the workplace can help reduce symptoms of
anxiety and depression, improve mental health, lower levels of sickness and increase job satisfaction and commitment. It enhances productivity and
reduces attrition too. Along with providing counselling in the workplace we also conduct
“*Counseling Skills Training*” for Human Resource managers, supervisors and
staff.
