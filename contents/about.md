## Vision

Throughout history there has been a deeply embedded conviction that under the right conditions people can help each other come to grips with problems and challenges in living.

 

Statistics today reveal that only a small fraction of help sought on any given day comes from professional helpers and therapists. Most people seek help in informal ways from informal sources. The analytics make for a convincing argument for us to stipulate, that as a society, we need Life Management Skills to be as much a part of our School and College curriculum as Math and History.

 

We at Co-Create Change see ourselves as enablers striving to institutionalize this conviction through our vision to train people to be able to help others and themselves deal with the distressing challenges of life.


 

As a first step towards actualizing this vision our mission is to build Counseling skills in Graduate and Post graduate students of Psychology and Counseling who have studied the curriculum but not had the opportunity to undergo skill training under the guided supervision of experts. Through bridging this gap between knowledge and application we envision these students becoming our ambassadors in Co-Creating Change.

 


Thereafter, as a part of our overall vision we aspire to square the circle by building counseling, mentoring and problem solving skills in each and every individual in society.
